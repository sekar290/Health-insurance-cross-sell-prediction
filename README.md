# Health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction
Machine Learning using several algorithms

This is modelling that I did on Health-insurance Dataset to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance. This Dataset could be find through Kaggle

### ABOUT DATASET
This dataset contains information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc. The dataset contains categorical and numerical features with feature 'Response' as the target.

**Note:**
- In here, I am trying to find out what would be interested in vehicle insurance through Exploratory Data Analyst (EDA).
- Also, I tried several algorithm to get best model that could predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance
